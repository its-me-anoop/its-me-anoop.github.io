    <h1>Dog Years</h1>
    <p>Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s
        life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life.</p>
    <p>How old would you be if you were a dog?</p>
    Your name: <input id="name" type="text" name="name" label="name" value="YOUR NAME"><br><br> Your age: <input id="age" type="number" name="age" label="age" value=0><br><br>
    <button onclick="dogYears()">Click me to calculate your age in dog years</button>
